üöñ Big Data Analysis using PySpark | Internship Project

üìå Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my internship to demonstrate skills in Big Data Analysis using scalable tools like PySpark. The objective was to analyze a large real-world dataset efficiently, extract meaningful insights, and visualize trends using Python and big data tools.

## üìä Dataset Used

This project uses the [New York City Taxi Trip dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration) from Kaggle.

> Note: You must have a Kaggle account and be logged in to access or download the dataset.




The dataset used in this project is based on New York City Taxi Trips, containing millions of records with fields such as:

pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime

fare_amount, tip_amount, trip_distance

passenger_count, payment_type

pickup_location_id, dropoff_location_id, and more.

This data simulates real-world big data that transportation companies and city planners often deal with.

üß∞ Tools & Technologies Used

Google Colab ‚Äì Cloud-based coding platform used to build and run the project.

PySpark ‚Äì Scalable data processing engine used for reading, filtering, grouping, and analyzing large datasets.

Pandas ‚Äì Used for lighter data handling and integration with visual libraries.

Seaborn & Matplotlib ‚Äì For creating clear and meaningful data visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatter plots).

üõ†Ô∏è Key Tasks 

Dataset Loading

Loaded a large CSV file using PySpark in Colab.

Initial Data Exploration

Used .show(), .printSchema(), and .describe() to understand data structure.

Big Data Processing & Analysis (13+ Insights)

Total fare and tip revenue

Most popular pickup & dropoff locations

Cost per mile analysis

Average trip distance

Passenger count distribution

Payment method popularity

Tip behavior based on fare

More grouped metrics using .groupBy() and .agg()

Data Visualization

Bar plot: Passenger count distribution

Pie chart: Payment type distribution

Histogram: Tip amount distribution

Scatter plot: Trip distance vs fare

Top pickup/dropoff zones

Conclusion

Markdown summary with clear takeaways from the analysis

üìà Real-World Applications

This type of analysis is widely applicable in:

Transport & Ride-Sharing ‚Äì Understanding fare trends, passenger behavior, and driver allocations.

Smart Cities ‚Äì Analyzing traffic flow and planning infrastructure.

Retail & Logistics ‚Äì Using movement trends to optimize services.

Finance & Fraud Detection ‚Äì Monitoring payment behavior and anomalies.

‚úÖ Final Deliverable

A fully-commented, well-organized Google Colab notebook that includes:

Data loading using PySpark

13+ insights with explanations

5+ professional visualizations

A markdown summary section.
